TODO:


3/29/16:

1. Fix Q_DECLARE_METATYPE bug. Something is going on that isnt matching up right
	1a. Check vec2/vec3/vec4/mat4 for default public constructers.
		THIS MAY BE THE ISSUE


2. Remove all implementation of vec2,vec3,vec4 into its implementation header file
    (Note: I use .inl as a file extension for files which contain template function
    declaration)
